    <p>Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages. Computer code is used to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day.I like to code because I enjoy it and prevent people doing tedious tasks, I know that I am making a difference in that personâ€™s life. They now have more time to be with their kids, more time to think up ideas (something computers cannot) and more time to connect to people.Coding is important to learn because computer programming teaches children to experiment and gives them the confidence to be creative. They will have the chance to design something that is entirely their own.As more people are depending on technology, we will need AI an coding to make that technology.</p>
